# ML walkthrough
 i have an ML project 1 due the next few weeks and i decided since im learning the basics that i would share my learning as a github repo, you will find the word document and all the material with the code 

## Data-Driven Machine Learning Tutorial

## Project Overview

Welcome to the Data-Driven Machine Learning Tutorial! This project aims to guide you through the process of developing machine learning models using real-world datasets. By the end of this tutorial, you will have a solid understanding of data preprocessing, feature extraction, exploratory data analysis, and model development.

### Key Highlights

- **Data Preprocessing**: Learn how to clean and prepare your data for analysis.
- **Feature Extraction**: Discover techniques to derive meaningful features from raw data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Uncover patterns and trends within your dataset.
- **Model Development**: Build and tune powerful ML models like XGBoost and Random Forest.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Assess your models using key metrics such as MAE, R2 Score, RMSE, and NRMSE.

### Course Structure

The project is organized as follows:

```
data-driven-ml-tutorial/
├── data/                 # Raw and processed data
├── results/              # Model evaluation results and visualizations
├── README.md             # Project overview and documentation
└── requirements.txt      # Python dependencies
```

### Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/data-driven-ml-tutorial.git
    cd data-driven-ml-tutorial
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment and install dependencies**:
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Open the tutorial notebooks** in the `tutorials/` folder to follow along with the step-by-step guides.


### Results

- **EDA Visualizations**: Highlighting key data insights.
- **Feature Selection Analysis**: Comparative analysis of different techniques.
- **Model Performance Metrics**: Detailed evaluation and analysis.
